Save your ontology mappings in `datasets/<dataset_name>/lists/master_labels_<source_dataset>.csv`.
Ontology mappings have the following structure:

Column 1: id of the source class (usually 0-N)

Column 2: corresponding label to the id

Column 3-M: labels of the extra dataset; make sure the spelling matches the spelling in labels.csv
